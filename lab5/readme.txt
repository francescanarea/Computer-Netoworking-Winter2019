Project 5
Routing

Implementation of link-state algorithm in a router.

Use:
1. update the machines file with various IPs of 'routers'
2. update costs file to input initially specified cost routes (routers must have global information about the network)
3. run lab5.c with the machines, costs and number of routers. in addition, lab5.c takes input of which router this terminal window will be running.  if using 4 routers, open 4 terminal windows and run lab5.c in each window.
4. input an update in the cost for the routers to calculate and converge to the least cost route using dijkstra.
